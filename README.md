# Power BI Analyst Report
## DIO challenge for the Python Data Analytics certification.

In this exercise, I used the tools available at the [Microsoft Power BI](https://www.microsoft.com/pt-br/power-platform/products/power-bi/), to create a report to a football team game.
The example is the stats of a hypothetical match and the step by step is available in the [Python Data Analytics bootcamp portal](https://web.dio.me/track/8b170530-da6f-487f-8774-c0bc58254f6c).
